# Calibrated Convolutions

The presented code belongs to the investigation from the Accepted paper to the BMVC23 Conference: **Convolution kernel adaptation to calibrated fisheye**

We provide 2 implementations. 

### offsetCalcFE.py
This code generates a PyTorch dictionary where offsets for deformable convolutions are computed for a given fisheye calibration. The calibration parameters used are acording the [Kannala-Brandt's camera model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642666). This program is quite rigid, since the dictionary has to be created prior the use with a neural network for fixed image resolution and convolution parameters. However, onces the dictionary is created the inference time is similar to any other convolution.

### FEConv_online.py
This code generates de offsets for the deformable convolution on-line. That means, as the feature map gets to the convolution, it computed and applies the calibrated deformation. This method is more flexible, but way more slower (it is a future work to create a faster implementation of this code). As in the previous programs, the calibration parameters used are acording the [Kannala-Brandt's camera model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1642666).
